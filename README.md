# FacialRecognitionSystemForMoroccanNationalTeam
It's a Facial Recognition System where I use cropped images and apply wavelet transform to extract  meaningful features for image identification. Using class labels as y, I  experiment with a simple SVM model to gauge performance. Then, I use  GridSearchCV to find the best model with optimal hyperparameters for  maximum accuracy.
